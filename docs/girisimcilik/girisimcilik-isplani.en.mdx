![bg right:10%](assets/rize-dijital-donusum.webp)

## **Step 1: What is the KOSGEB Business Plan and Why is it Necessary?**

- **What is it?**: The business plan required for KOSGEB applications is a comprehensive document that shows your business goals and how you will achieve them.
- **Why is it Necessary?**: You must have a business plan to demonstrate your business’s financial soundness and present your plans to investors and KOSGEB.

#### **Example:**

- "Y Gıda Ltd. aims to become a snack brand distributing nationwide in Turkey by applying to KOSGEB support programs in 2024."

## **Step 2: Executive Summary**

- **What is it?**: The top-level summary of your business plan briefly describes your business and objectives.
- **What Should it Include?**: The company’s core values, the product/service you offer, your target audience, and market opportunities.

#### **Example:**

- "X Electronics is a company that produces electronic devices with domestic production in Turkey. We aim to double our production capacity in 2024 with KOSGEB support."

## **Step 3: Target Audience and Market Analysis**

- **What is it?**: Identify who your product/service is for and your position in the market.
- **What Should it Include?**: Who are your customers, how big is the market, and who are your competitors? KOSGEB will want to see details in this area.

#### **Example:**

- "Our target audience is technology enthusiasts aged 18-40. There are strong competitors like Z Electronics in the Turkish market, but we plan to differentiate by leveraging our domestic production advantage."

- **What Should it Include?**: How your product/service solves customer problems and how it differs from competitors.

#### **Example:**

- "Our product is durable electronic devices produced entirely with local materials. It is more affordable and long-lasting compared to our competitors."

## **Step 7: Financial Plan and KOSGEB Support**

- **What is it?**: This part of your business plan should detail how you will use KOSGEB’s support and your financial projections.
- **What Should it Include?**: Revenue projections, costs, KOSGEB support, capital requirements.

#### **Example:**

- "We plan an investment of 500,000 TL for 2024. With the 100,000 TL grant support from KOSGEB, we aim to expand our production facility."

## **Step 8: Risks and Solution Strategies**

- **What is it?**: Every business faces potential risks, and KOSGEB wants to know how you will mitigate these risks.
- **What Should it Include?**: Market, financial, and operational risks, along with proposed solutions.

#### **Example:**
